# Predictive-Image-Compression
This project implements a predictive image codec based on spatial prediction and entropy coding, inspired by JPEG-LS principles. The system combines quantization, MED prediction, residual processing, and arithmetic coding to reduce the bit rate while maintaining high reconstruction quality.
